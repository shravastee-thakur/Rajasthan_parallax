      <h1>Jodhpur</h1>
      <p>
        Jodhpur, the second largest city in Rajasthan is popularly known as the
        Blue City. The name is clearly befitting as most of the architecture –
        forts, palaces, temples, havelis and even houses are built in vivid
        shades of blue. The strapping forts that tower this magnificent city sum
        up to a spectacle you would not want to miss. The mammoth, imposing
        fortress of Mehrangarh has a landscape dominating a rocky ridge with the
        eight gates leading out of the fortress. The new city is located outside
        the structure. Jodhpur is also known for the rare breed of horses known
        as Marwari or Malani, which are only found here. Jodhpur is primarily
        famous for its temples, lakes and snacks, with the magnificent
        Mehrangarh Fort being the main attraction. Jaswant Tada and Umaid Bhawan
        Palace are also among the top attractions in Jodhpur.

        Udaipur, also known as the City of Lakes, is one of the most visited
        tourist places in Rajasthan. Located around stunning water lakes and

        or relax in one of the extraordinary hotels, and you will discover the

      <h1>Jaisalmer</h1>
      <p>
        Jaisalmer is a prominent tourist spot located in the northwestern state
        of Rajasthan in India. It is known as the 'golden city' due to its
        golden dunes and castles clad in golden honey sandstone. This 'Golden
        City’ is located close to the Pakistan border and in close proximity to
        the Thar Desert. The city’s most prominent landmark is the Jaisalmer
        Fort, also called Sonar Qila (Golden Fort). Unlike most other forts in
        India, Jaisalmer Fort is not just a tourist attraction. It houses shops,
        hotels and ancient havelis (homes) where generations continue to live.
        Jaisalmer is adorned with lakes, ornate Jain temples and havelis. Climb
        onto the camel saddle and make your way through this desert to camp
        under the starry night sky for an unforgettable experience. The
        Jaisalmer Fort stands as a citadel with narrow alleys inhabited by
        people for generations and shops selling colourful handicrafts.
